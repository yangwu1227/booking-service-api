## Environment

### Install PDM

The dependency manager used in this project is [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm). To install it, run the following command:

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

Or, alternatively, other [installation methods](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation) can be used.

### Install Dependencies

The dependencies are broken into groups:

* **Default dependencies**: required for the core functionality of the project in production.

* **Development dependencies**: required for development, testing, and documentation.

The specified python version in `pyproject.toml` is `>=3.11`, and so a **python 3.11** interpreter should be used. 

#### Conda

To do so with [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):

```bash
$ conda search python | grep " 3\.\(11\)\."
$ conda create --name booking_service_api -y python=3.11.9
$ conda activate booking_service_api
$ pdm use -f $(which python3)
$ pdm install
```

#### Pyenv

To do so with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv), use the [pdm venv](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/reference/cli/#venv) command:

```bash 
$ pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.\(11\)\." 
$ pyenv install 3.11.9
$ pdm venv create --name booking_service_api --with virtualenv 3.11.9 
# To activate the virtual environment
$ eval $(pdm venv activate booking_service_api) 
$ pdm install
```

Use `--with venv` to create the virtual environment using `venv` (comes with standard library) instead of `virtualenv` (third-party package but more performant). To create the venv in the project root instead of `pdm config venv.location`, omit the `--name` option:

```bash
$ pdm config venv.in_project true
$ pdm venv create --with venv 3.11.9
```

## Docker Compose for Local Development

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used for local development to isolate the application and its dependencies in a containerized environment. Two services are defined the the `compose.yml` file:

1. `test`: The service for running the application, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The following directories are mapped or [bind-mounted](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) from the host to the container:

    - `app/**`: The application code to run the FastAPI application.
    - `tests/**`: The test code as all tests are run in the container.
    - `pyproject.toml`: The project configuration file, which includes the dependencies, pytest configurations, and other project settings.
    - `migrations`: The Alembic migrations directory to manage the database schema. This is mounted to the container to apply migrations each time a new container is created (i.e., `docker compose up --detach --build`).

2. `db-test`: The service for running the PostgreSQL database for testing purposes. The database is initialized with the schema and data required for testing based on the migration files in the `migrations` directory.

The entrypoing script of the `test.Dockerfile` waits for the PostgreSQL database to start before running the application. This is done by checking if the port `5432` is open using the `nc` command. The script is as follows:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

echo "Waiting for postgres to start..."

while ! nc -z db-test 5432; do
  # The nc (Netcat) is utility to check network connectivity
  # The -z flag ensures nc only scan for open ports without sending data
  # If the connection fails (i.e., PostgreSQL isn't up yet), the loop continues
  sleep 0.1
done

echo "PostgreSQL started"

# 'exec' replaces the current shell process with the command and arguments passed to the script, preserving all arguments as separate arguments
# For example: ./script.sh command --option value -> exec command --option value
exec "$@"
```

### Build and Run the Containers

To build the images and run the containers in the background:

```bash
$ docker compose up --detach --build
```

This setup allows for automatic reloading of the application when changes are made to the code during development. The application is available at [http://localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004) or whichever port is specified in the `compose.yml` file.

To stop the containers without removing them:

```bash
$ docker compose stop
```

To stop, remove the containers, and remove named volumes:

```bash
$ docker compose down --volumes
```

To view the logs of the services:

```bash
$ docker compose logs <service-name>
```

To run an interactive shell in a service container:

```bash
# Or /bin/bash
$ docker compose exec <service-name> /bin/sh
```

### Testing with Pytest

The test suite is run using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and is divided into three categories:

<center>

| Test Type          | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Tests**     | Validates individual components like models, services, and utility functions.                 |
| **Integration Tests** | Tests the integration between database services and API endpoints.                          |
| **End-to-End Tests**  | Simulates real user flows, ensuring the entire application functions as expected.           |

</center>

 The integration tests are run against a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. The `DATABASE_URL_TEST` database connection string is set as an environment variable in the `compose.yml` file.

```bash
$ docker compose exec <service-name> python3 -m pytest -s tests/integration tests/unit -v
```

The end-to-end tests are run against the FastAPI application running in `dev` mode on aws. The `.github/workflows/ci_cd_end_to_end.yml` workflow is configured to run after the `.github/workflows/ecr_ecs_dev.yml` workflow completes **successfully**. It sets up the aws cli and fetches the authentication credentials from the aws secrets manager to run the end-to-end tests.

## Automation 

### Formatting with Black and Isort

The `scripts` directory contains a `run_black_isort.sh` shell script that runs [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) on the project files. The script is also used in the GitHub Actions workflows to ensure consistent code formatting. 

Run the script as follows:

```bash
$ cd services/booking
$ scripts/run_black_isort.sh
```
